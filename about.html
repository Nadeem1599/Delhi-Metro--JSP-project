							<p>The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., abbreviated to DMRC, is a Centre-state Public Sector company that operates the Delhi Metro. The DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail, and high-speed rail projects in India and abroad.[1]</p>
							<p>The Delhi Metro is a metro system serving Delhi and its satellite cities of Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad in National Capital Region in India.[10] Delhi Metro is the world's 12th largest metro system in terms of both length and number of stations.[11] A member of the Nova Group of Metros,[12] the network consists of five colour-coded regular lines and the faster Airport Express line, with a total length of 213 kilometres (132 mi)[1] serving 160 stations (including 6 on Airport Express line).[1] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge.[13] The metro has an average daily ridership of 2.4 million passengers, and, as of August 2010, had already carried over 1.25 billion passengers since its inception.[14]

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation from Government of India and Government of Delhi, built and operates the Delhi Metro. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has been certified by the United Nations as the first metro rail and rail-based system in the world to get "carbon credits for reducing greenhouse gas emissions" and helping in reducing pollution levels in the city by 630,000 tonnes every year DMRC operates around 2000 trips daily between 05:30 till 00:00 running with a headway varying between 1â€“2 minutes and 4â€“10 minutes.[16][17] The trains are usually of four, six and eight-coach. The power output is supplied by 25-kilovolt, 50-hertz alternating current through overhead catenary.

Planning for the metro started in 1984, when the Delhi Development Authority and the Urban Arts Commission came up with a proposal for developing a multi-modal transport system for the city. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) was incorporated in May 1995, construction started in 1998, and the first section, on the Red Line, opened in 2002. The development of network was divided into phases, Phase I containing 3 lines was completed by 2006, and Phase II in 2011. Phase III is scheduled for completion by 2016.</p>
